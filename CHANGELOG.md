# Changelog

All notable template changes are documented here. The format follows Keep a Changelog, and releases use semantic version tags.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Export-ready public Core API annotations and a Debug-only assertion foundation.
- Generated runtime build identity and dependency-free Client help/version commands.
- A canonical SDK consumer example and validated package-only CMake imported target.
- Identity and dependency lock manifests.
- Transactional full-template rename support.
- Doctor, LLVM coverage, SDK package, and script regression commands.
- Native x64/ARM64 selection and concrete compiler resolution.
- CI coverage, compatibility, security, dependency, and release-package automation.

### Changed

- Public Core headers now use the `Core/` include prefix.
- Logging owns private asynchronous spdlog state and supports console suppression.
- Dist builds use link-time optimization and CI treats template warnings as errors.
- Release SDKs include complete dependency licenses and separate platform symbols; Dist remains stripped.
- CodeQL and Dependency Review are explicitly opt-in and strict when enabled.

### Fixed

- Release packaging now compiles and runs a standalone consumer from the extracted SDK archive.
- Windows packaging supports Git repositories without a first commit, and vendor probes suppress expected native Git errors.
- Linux coverage resolves `llvm-profdata` and `llvm-cov` from the selected Clang major version.
- Logger handles no longer expose a raw spdlog pointer beyond their lifecycle lock.
- Security workflows expose an always-running activation check so disabled advanced-security jobs cannot look silently successful.
- Linux Premake bootstrap now accepts release archives whose executable bit is not preserved.
- ARM64 Premake source builds install the platform UUID development headers before compilation.
- Vendor bootstrap verifies the committed submodule pointer and restores detached working trees to that exact hash.
- macOS tool version checks consume complete command output, avoiding `xcodebuild` broken-pipe crashes.
- Linux Clang bootstrap installs the LLVM profiling and coverage utilities required by coverage reports.
- Lazy and explicit logger initialization now serialize under one lifecycle lock.
- macOS bootstrap accepts Command Line Tools without full Xcode for non-Xcode generators.
- Arch installation performs a full package upgrade instead of a partial database synchronization.
- Windows detects containing Git worktrees and rename updates public-header include guards.
